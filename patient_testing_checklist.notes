# Patient Management Manual Testing Checklist

## Database Migration Testing
- [ ] Run simple_patient_table_update.sql migration
- [ ] Verify new columns exist: first_name, second_name, first_surname, second_surname, status
- [ ] Confirm status constraint works (only 'active' or 'inactive' allowed)
- [ ] Check indexes were created properly
- [ ] Verify existing dummy data has default values

## Patient Form - Create New Patient (/patients/new)
- [ ] Navigation: "Add Patient" button from patients list works
- [ ] Form loads with all fields visible
- [ ] Required field validation:
  - [ ] Patient code is required (shows error if empty)
  - [ ] First name is required (shows error if empty)  
  - [ ] First surname is required (shows error if empty)
- [ ] Optional fields work:
  - [ ] Second name can be left empty
  - [ ] Second surname can be left empty
- [ ] Status toggle:
  - [ ] Defaults to "active" (switch ON)
  - [ ] Can toggle to "inactive" (switch OFF)
- [ ] Form submission:
  - [ ] Valid data saves successfully
  - [ ] Success toast appears
  - [ ] Redirects to patients list after save
  - [ ] New patient appears in list
- [ ] Cancel button returns to patients list

## Patient Form - Edit Existing Patient (/patients/:id/edit)
- [ ] Navigation: "Edit Patient" from actions dropdown works
- [ ] Form pre-populates with existing patient data
- [ ] All fields are editable
- [ ] Status toggle reflects current patient status
- [ ] Form validation works same as create form
- [ ] Save updates patient successfully
- [ ] Success toast appears
- [ ] Returns to patients list after save
- [ ] Changes are visible in patients table
- [ ] Cancel button returns to patients list without saving

## Patients Table Display (/patients)
- [ ] Table shows all patients
- [ ] Columns display correctly:
  - [ ] Patient Code
  - [ ] Name formatted as "{first_surname} {second_surname}, {first_name} {second_name}"
  - [ ] Status with toggle switch
  - [ ] Active Trials (mock data)
  - [ ] Last Activity (mock data)
  - [ ] Actions dropdown
- [ ] Status toggle functionality:
  - [ ] Switch shows current status (ON = active, OFF = inactive)
  - [ ] Clicking switch updates status immediately
  - [ ] Success toast appears on status change
  - [ ] Status text updates (active/inactive)
  - [ ] Page refreshes to show change
- [ ] Actions dropdown:
  - [ ] "View Details" link works (goes to /patients/:id)

## Search Functionality
- [ ] Search box appears and is functional
- [ ] Search works by:
  - [ ] Patient code (full or partial)
  - [ ] First name (full or partial)
  - [ ] First surname (full or partial)
  - [ ] Full formatted name display
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] Empty search shows all patients
- [ ] No results message shows when no matches

## Name Display Format Testing
Test with various name combinations:
- [ ] First + First Surname only: "Doe, John"
- [ ] First + Second + First Surname: "Doe, John Michael"  
- [ ] First + First + Second Surname: "Doe Smith, John"
- [ ] All four fields: "Doe Smith, John Michael"
- [ ] Special characters in names work properly
- [ ] Long names don't break layout

## Navigation & Routing
- [ ] /patients loads patients list
- [ ] /patients/new loads create form
- [ ] /patients/:id loads patient detail (if implemented)
- [ ] /patients/:id/edit loads edit form
- [ ] Invalid patient ID shows error
- [ ] Back buttons work from all forms
- [ ] Browser back/forward works properly

## Error Handling
- [ ] Database connection errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid patient ID in edit form shows error
- [ ] Duplicate patient codes are handled (if constraint exists)
- [ ] Network errors show appropriate messages
- [ ] Form validation errors are user-friendly

## Data Persistence
- [ ] New patients persist after browser refresh
- [ ] Patient edits persist after browser refresh
- [ ] Status changes persist after browser refresh
- [ ] Search state is reset on page load (expected behavior)

## UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Forms are responsive on mobile
- [ ] Table is responsive/scrollable on mobile
- [ ] Loading states appear appropriately
- [ ] Success/error toasts are readable
- [ ] Form layout is intuitive
- [ ] Switch component is accessible
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works

## Integration Testing
- [ ] Patient list refreshes after creating new patient
- [ ] Patient list updates after editing patient
- [ ] Status changes reflect immediately in table
- [ ] Search continues to work after CRUD operations
- [ ] Navigation between pages maintains context

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Large patient lists load reasonably fast
- [ ] Search is responsive with many patients
- [ ] Status toggle is immediate (no lag)
- [ ] Form submissions don't cause delays

## Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome: All functionality works
- [ ] Firefox: All functionality works
